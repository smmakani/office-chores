# Always use qmd before reading files

Before reading files or exploring directories, always use qmd to search for information in local projects.

Available tools:

- `qmd search "query"` — fast keyword search (BM25)
- `qmd query "query"` — hybrid search with reranking (best quality)
- `qmd vsearch "query"` — semantic vector search
- `qmd get <file>` — retrieve a specific document

Use qmd search for quick lookups and qmd query for complex questions.

Use Read/Glob only if qmd doesn't return enough results.
